# CLAUDE.md — rules for AI/automated contributors

These apply to every automated contributor (Claude Code, including claude.ai/code
in the browser). They exist because past work shipped non-functional "decorative"
abilities and then summarized them as complete. Treat these as hard requirements,
not suggestions.

## 1. "Done" means engine-enforced AND tested

A gameplay rule, unit ability, card effect, hero specialty, or building effect is
**done only if both** are true:
1. the engine actually executes it, and
2. a test fails if that logic is removed.

If you cannot do both, it is **NOT done**. Say so explicitly in your reply, leave
it clearly marked not-implemented, and stop — do **not** paste the printed rules
text into a display field and move on. Pasted-but-inert text is a stub, never a
feature.

## 2. Every card/unit definition must state exactly what the engine implements

A human must be able to read a definition and know precisely what runs.

- **Units** (`src/data/factions/units.ts`): the `abilities: [...]` array is the
  *complete, literal* list of engine-wired effects for that side — no more, no
  less. `abilityText` is printed-card flavor/reference only and is **never**
  proof that something works.
  - If `abilityText` describes anything the engine does NOT do, add a comment on
    that side stating exactly what runs, e.g.
    `// engine: ignore-combat-penalties only; the +1 Power activation is display-only`.
  - A side with `abilities: []` does **nothing** mechanically, whatever its
    `abilityText` says. It is a stub.
- **Cards** (`src/data/cards/*`): `effect` + `implementationStatus` are the truth.
  Use `implementationStatus: "not-implemented"` (with a no-op effect) for anything
  not wired. Never set `"implemented"` unless the effect actually executes.
- Known display-only abilities must be **declared in one explicit registry**
  (e.g. `DISPLAY_ONLY_ABILITIES`) so a stub is a conscious, reviewable entry — not
  something a reader has to reverse-engineer.

## 3. Required enforcement (NOT yet in the repo — add it before relying on this)

A test must assert: every unit `abilityText` that describes an effect is either
backed by an implemented `abilities` tag or listed in `DISPLAY_ONLY_ABILITIES`.
New decorative text then fails CI until it is consciously declared. **This test
does not exist yet** — until it does, rules #1–#2 are guidance, not enforcement.
Do not describe them as enforced.

## 4. How to report work (no dressing up)

- Lead with what does **NOT** work / what is display-only. Caveats go first, never
  in a footnote.
- Do not use ✓/✅ or words like "complete", "fully implemented", or "no decorative
  features" for anything you cannot back with a named, passing test.
- If you took a shortcut or shipped a stub, say that in the first sentence.

## Where this file lives / why it works on the web

This is the repository-root `CLAUDE.md`. Claude Code auto-loads it as context at
the start of every session, including claude.ai/code in the browser. The web
environment clones the repo fresh each session, so **only what is committed to the
default branch (`main`) takes effect there.** Keep this file committed on `main`.
Nested `CLAUDE.md` files in subdirectories are also loaded when working in those
folders; per-user `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` does **not** persist on the web.

## Current known stubs (display-only, NOT implemented)

None tracked. Every item this list previously named has since been wired and is
covered by a test that fails if the logic is removed:
- `tower.genies` few & pack — "discard from deck, take a Spell" → `genie-spell-draw-few`
  / `genie-spell-draw-pack` (`DECK_DISCARD_TAKE_SPELL`); see
  `src/engine/expansion-creature-abilities.test.ts` ("Genie Wish").
- `tower.magi` pack — "+1 Power to the first spell you cast this round" →
  `magi-power-boost`; see `src/engine/decorative-faction-abilities.test.ts`.
- `tower.gargoyles` / `tower.titans` — the ongoing-effect immunity →
  `gargoyle-spell-ward` / `titan-ignore-ongoing`; see
  `src/engine/expansion-creature-abilities.test.ts` ("Gargoyle / Titan
  ongoing-effect immunity").
- `tower.iron_golems` — spell-damage reduction → `reduce-spell-damage-1` /
  `reduce-spell-damage-2`; see `src/engine/decorative-faction-abilities.test.ts`.
- Solmyr I/IV/VI, Cyra IV/VI, Torosar I/IV/VI — now implemented;
  `src/engine/hero-specialty-levels.test.ts` asserts "has no remaining
  not-implemented hero specialty" and `src/engine/tower-hero-specialties.test.ts`
  exercises each. (`PENDING_TOWER_SPECIALTIES` no longer exists.)

This section is maintained by hand — the rule #3 enforcement test still does
**not** exist, so re-verify any "stub" claim against `src/data/factions/units.ts`
and the tests before trusting it.
