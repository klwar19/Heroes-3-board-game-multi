/**
 * Individual house-rule toggles (BINH). Historically the BINH tweaks were an
 * all-or-nothing bundle switched by `ruleset: "binh" | "legacy"`. This registry
 * lifts each tweak into its OWN on/off flag so a table can mix-and-match: keep
 * the split decks but drop the Estates nerf, buff Griffins in a Legacy game, and
 * so on.
 *
 * Resolution order for "is rule X on":
 *   1. an explicit per-rule flag in `options.houseRules` (the toggle the user
 *      clicked) — authoritative;
 *   2. otherwise the rule's default FOR THE CHOSEN MODE — every rule defaults ON
 *      in "binh" and OFF in "legacy" (i.e. picking a mode is a preset that sets
 *      all the still-untouched toggles).
 *
 * The resolved booleans are frozen onto `adventure.houseRules` at setup so the
 * engine reads plain booleans during play; `houseRuleEnabled` falls back to the
 * mode default for legacy snapshots / the combat sandbox (no adventure state).
 *
 * IMPORTANT (CLAUDE.md #1): every id in this registry gates REAL engine
 * behaviour with a covering test that fails if the gate is removed. A toggle
 * that changes nothing is a decorative stub and must not live here — declare it
 * only once its wiring exists.
