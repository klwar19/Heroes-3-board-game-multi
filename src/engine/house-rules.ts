/**
 * Individual house-rule toggles (BINH). Historically the BINH tweaks were an
 * all-or-nothing bundle switched by `ruleset: "binh" | "legacy"`. This registry
 * lifts each tweak into its OWN on/off flag so a table can mix-and-match:
 * keep the split decks but drop the Estates nerf, for example.
 *
 * Legacy is a SOFT preset: clicking it turns every house rule off (and clears
 * overrides), but does NOT lock the toggles — a player may re-enable any rule
 * afterwards. Explicit per-rule flags always win over the mode default, in
 * both BINH and Legacy.
 *
 * The resolved booleans are frozen onto `adventure.houseRules` at setup so the
 * engine reads plain booleans during play; `houseRuleEnabled` falls back to the
 * mode default for snapshots / the combat sandbox (no adventure state).
 *
 * IMPORTANT (CLAUDE.md #1): every id in this registry gates REAL engine
 * behaviour with a covering test that fails if the gate is removed. A toggle
 * that changes nothing is a decorative stub and must not live here — declare it
 * only once its wiring exists.
