/**
 * Room-server / client compatibility fingerprint.
 *
 * The app ships as two independently-deployed halves:
 *   - the Vercel frontend (this bundle), and
 *   - the PartyKit room server (party/index.ts), which is the authoritative
 *     rules engine and validates every action.
 *
 * They drift apart when one is redeployed without the other — e.g. the UI
 * ships new heroes (Moandor/Zydar) or a new action (Hire a Secondary Hero)
 * but the room server still runs the old engine and silently rejects them.
 * That looked like "the hero can't be selected / hiring does nothing".
 *
 * Both halves compile ENGINE_SIGNATURE from their own copy of the engine, and
 * the server stamps it onto every snapshot it sends. The client compares the
 * server's signature against its own; a mismatch surfaces a visible "room
 * server is out of date — redeploy PartyKit" banner instead of a silent
 * failure. See README "Deploying" and .github/workflows/deploy-partykit.yml.

/**
 * Bump when the action set or the persisted GameState schema changes in a way

 * semantics, a new required state field). Pure content additions — heroes,

 * do NOT need a bump.

// v14: authoritative combat semantics changed so Rebirth resolves BEFORE a
// Creature Bank Stack Token or Pack→Few layer is lost. The earlier v13 worker
// consumed the Stack Token first, so a 5-damage hit left a Crypt Skeleton
// un-Stacked at 1 HP even when the frontend contained the fix. This is a pure
// reducer change (the catalogs below do not detect it), therefore the explicit
// protocol bump is required to make every stale room/server show the version-
// skew warning and to invalidate cached v13 room snapshots.
// v15: verified-identity seats (Phase 2). A new action (SET_ROOM_REQUIRE_AUTH),
// two new state fields (RoomMember.userId, RoomMembershipState.requireAuth) and a
// changed reducer contract — the seat-ownership guard now binds a signed-in actor
// to their verified account id (a spoofed actorClientId no longer grants a seat)
// and joinRoom stamps that id onto the member. A stale room server would ignore
// the new action and the verified-identity guard, so the explicit bump surfaces
// the version-skew banner instead of silently reverting to clientId-only seats.
